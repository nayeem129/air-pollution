    <h1>AIR POLLUTION</h1> 
  <br>  <p style="font-size: 22px;">Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere.There are many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or built environment (for example, acid rain).Air pollution can be caused by both human activitiesand natural phenomena.<br>

	<h2>Major Causes of Air Pollution and its control method</h2>
	<h3>1.The Burning of Fossil Fuels</h3>
	<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee burning of fossil fuels.jpg">
	<p>Most of the air pollution takes place due to the incomplete burning of fossil fuels. These include coal, oil, and gasoline to produce energy for electricity or transportation. The release of CO at a high level indicates how much fossil fuel is burned. This also emits other toxic pollutants like nitrogen oxides into the air. Inhaling air induced with pollutants due to the burning of natural gas and fossil fuel reduces the heart’s ability to pump enough oxygen. Hence causing one to suffer from various respiratory and heart illnesses. Furthermore, the nitrogen oxides are responsible for acid rain and the formation of smog. </p><br>
<p>When fossil fuels are burned, they emit more than just CO2.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Coal-fired power stations alone account for 35% of harmful mercury emissions in the US.</li>
	<li>Two-thirds of SO2 emissions cause acid rain</li>
	<li>The great majority of dust (particle pollution) is released in our air due to fossil fuel burning.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Method to control burning of fossils fuels</h4>
<oL>
	<li>Increasing plant efficiency so that less fuel is combusted.</li>
	<li>Practicing conservation at home to reduce overall electrical demands.</li>
	<li>Using alternate transportation to reduce fossil fuel consumption.</li>
	<li>Using alternative energy sources.</li>
	<li>Supporting sustainable agriculture.</li>
</oL>
<h3>2.Industrial Emisssion</h3>
<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee indudstrial emition.jpg">
<P>Industrial activities emit several pollutants in the air that affect the air quality more than we can even imagine. Particulate matter 2.5 and 10, NO2, SO2, and CO are key pollutants that are emitted from industries that use coal and wood as their primary energy source for the production of their goods. Industrial pollution effects associated with your health can range from</P><br>
<ul>
	<li>Irritation in your eyes and throat</li>
	<li>Breathing issue</li>
	<li>VOCs and other emissions from industries can aggregate respiratory disorders like asthma and bronchitis.</li>
	<li>O3 is also released from industries that can increase in asthma attacks.</li>
	<p>Huge amounts of organic chemicals like CO2, hydrocarbons, etc. are released by the industries including other toxicants. They furthermore affect the climate as CO2 causes a greenhouse effect. Hence, causing the heat to be trapped within the earth’s atmosphere. Therefore, the temperature and humidity increase. More and more industries are being built as the demand grows. And as a result the emissions also increase day by day. We are already observing the after-effects of this, as the earth’s temperature rises by 1 degree Celsius per decade.</p>
</ul>
<h4>Method to control Industrial emisssion</h4>
<p>There are several methods to control industrial emissions. According to the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, some of the ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial sector include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Energy efficiency: This involves using energy-efficient technologies and processes to reduce energy consumption and associated emissions.</li>
	<li>Energy efficiency: This involves using energy-efficient technologies and processes to reduce energy consumption and associated emissions.</li>
	<li>Use of renewable energy: This involves using renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower to generate electricity and heat.</li>
	<li>Efficient use and recycling of materials: This involves reducing waste and reusing or recycling materials to reduce emissions.</li>

</ul>
<h3>3.Indoor Pollution</h3>
<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee indoor pollution.png">
<p>Indoor air pollution is created by the release of harmful pollutants inside. These can include fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and various other toxins.

	Indoor air pollution is a big problem in developing countries, where people often burn fuels indoors for cooking and heating. It is also a concern for people living in energy-efficient homes. These properties tend to be relatively airtight, meaning that the air inside can quickly become stagnant and pollutant levels can rise rapidly.
	
	And while pollution in all forms can be harmful, indoor air pollution is particularly pernicious because people are often steeped in it for long periods of time.
	
	</p>
	<h4>Method to control Indoor Air pollution</h4>
	<p>Indoor air pollution can be reduced by following some simple steps:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Open Windows <br>
			Adequate ventilation is key to promoting healthy indoor air, and opening windows (when it's not too cold or the pollen count isn't too high, of course) is an easy way to encourage a good exchange of indoor and outdoor air.</li>
		<li>Ban Smoking <br>
			"Absolutely no cigarette smoke," says Norman Edelman, MD, senior scientific adviser for the American Lung Association. Secondhand smoke impairs respiratory health and is responsible for about 3,000 lung cancer deaths per year in nonsmokers, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.</li>
		<li>Give Your Pets a Bath <br>
			If you have pets, bathe them and wash their bedding often to reduce allergy-causing dander. And we hate to break it to you, but you should also keep them out of bedrooms.</li>
		<li>Use Exhaust Fans <br>
			Run fans in the kitchen to remove cooking fumes and in bathrooms to remove steam. Also be sure that your dryer vents to the outside to minimize lint. To reduce the level of pollen in the air on days it's not possible to open the windows, run your window air conditioner on the fan setting with a clean filter.</li>
		<li>Put Down a Doormat <br>
			Wiping shoes can reduce pollutants carried into the house. Better yet, establish a shoes-off policy.</li>
		<li> Try an Air Purifier <br>
			An air purifier alone won't remove all the impurities in your indoor air. But if you've gone to the effort to keep allergens and other pollutants out of your home, an air purifier could help to reduce them further. And running one in the bedroom of a child who suffers from asthma certainly won't hurt and may even be of some benefit.</li>
		<li> Store Chemicals Safely <br>
			Store solvents, glues, and pesticides away from living areas. And when possible, use homemade cleaning products, such as a mixture of white vinegar and water.</li>
		<li>Try to Stay Dry <br>
			To reduce mold, keep moisture down by using a dehumidifier and cleaning the filter regularly. </li>
		<li>Minimize Carpeting <br>
			It can trap pollutants such as dust mites, pet dander, mold spores, and other dirt and dust. Choose hard-surface flooring instead.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>3.Wildfires</h3>
<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee wildfires image.jpeg">
<p>Climate change is not just increasing wildfire but also spiking air pollution. Burning stubble and farm residue is also a major contribution to wildfire. It causes increased PM2.5 in the air which collides with other harmful substances like chemical gas and pollen creating smog. Smog makes the air hazy and people find it difficult to breathe. Visibility also decreases as a result of this smog. Difficulty in breathing, irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat, itchiness in the respiratory tract, etc. are all symptoms of inhaling smog.</p>
<h4>Method to reduce wildfires pollutiin.</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Stay informed: Keep yourself updated on the air quality index in your area. You can check the air quality index on the EPA website or through the AirNow app.</li>
	<li>Limit outdoor activities: Avoid outdoor activities as much as possible, especially during peak wildfire season. If you need to go outside, wear a mask to protect yourself from inhaling smoke particles.</li>
	<li>Create a clean indoor environment: Close all windows and doors to prevent smoke from entering your home. Use an air purifier with a HEPA filter to remove smoke particles from the air. Dust, vacuum, and mop your home regularly to reduce the amount of smoke particles that settle on surfaces </li>
	<li>Use air conditioners correctly: Set your air conditioner to recirculate mode to prevent smoke from entering your home. Replace the air filter in your air conditioner frequently to ensure it is working efficiently </li>
	<li>Create an emergency plan: Wildfire conditions can unexpectedly worsen, so to protect yourself, it’s important to have an emergency plan in case of the worst-case scenario. Keep an eye on the AQI levels in your area and plan to evacuate should the pollution level hit unsafe levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.Transportation</h3>
<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee Vehicle-Pollution.jpg">
<p>Cars on the roads are increasing day by day. There is no denying that vehicle pollution is the major contributor to air pollution, especially in urban cities, where car ownership rates are more as compared to rural areas. When the car burns gasoline, it emits pollutants in the air which is as harmful as smoking 10 cigarettes a day. Your vehicle emits:
Carbon monoxide,</p>

<ul>
	<li>Carbon monoxide</li>
	<li>Monocarbons</li>
	<li>Nitrogen oxide</li>
	<li>Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)</li>
</ul>
<p>When vehicle pollution is high in the atmosphere, it creates a hole in the ozone layer contributing to smog and causing various health issues.

	Large numbers of cars and other vehicles on the roads contribute to traffic congestion on the roads, affecting the air quality of that particular area to a great extent. This necessitates the need to monitor the air quality at local level, for each area, so that identifying the sources and taking the proper measures can be done.
	
	Taking proper and effective measures as individuals to control vehicular emissions such as carpooling, using public transportation (metros, buses, rails) will help in reducing the vehicular emissions.</p>
	<h4>Method to control transportation air pollution</h4>
	<p>Air pollution caused by transportation is a major concern worldwide. Here are some possible methods to control it:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Change the way we live and think: We need to change our attitude towards cars and commutes. We can reduce the number of cars on the road by carpooling, using public transportation, walking, or biking. We can also reduce the distance driven and time spent on the road by combining errands and reducing trips </li>
		<li>Use cleaner fuels: We can switch to cleaner fuels such as hydrogen fuel cells, which produce only water as a byproduct, or electric cars, which produce no emissions 1.</li>
		<li>Reduce idling: Idling is a major source of air pollution. We can avoid excessive idling of our automobiles by turning off the engine when parked or waiting in traffic </li>
		<li>improve infrastructure: Improving infrastructure such as roads and traffic flow can help reduce air pollution. We can also encourage the use of public transportation by building up public transportation systems </li>

	</ul>
	<h3>5. Open Burning of Garbage Waste</h3>
	<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee  Open Burning of Garbage Waste.jpeg">
	<p>Open burning of garbage is much more harmful to your health and the environment than one may think. As per Engage EPW, Delhi Air Pollution is choking public health. Delhi generates a whopping 9500 tons of waste every day, which makes it India’s second waste dumping city. Exposure to open burning of garbage waste can pose serious health risks including:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Cancer</li>
		<li>Impairment of the immune system</li>
        <li>Reduced reproductive functions</li>
        <li>Can also affect the developing nervous system.</li>
		
	</ol>
	<p>Open air garbage burning releases toxins such as black carbon, soot, and carcinogens. It actively contributes to the greenhouse effect, and in turn to climate change. Black carbon and soot gets deposited on the ice peaks, which results in their meltdown. 

		Open garbage burning causes skin irritation, aggravates asthma and other respiratory diseases and illnesses, increases the risk of heart diseases, and difficulties in breathing, nausea and headaches.</p>

		<h4> Method to reduce burning of garbage wastage</h4>
		<p>Open burning of garbage is a major environmental and health hazard. It releases harmful pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds into the air, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer 1. Here are some ways to control the burning of garbage waste:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle: The most effective way to reduce the amount of waste that needs to be burned is to reduce, reuse, and recycle. This can be done by avoiding disposable items, buying products in bulk, and donating items you no longer need </li>
			<li>Proper Waste Disposal: Proper waste disposal is essential to prevent open burning of garbage. Municipalities should provide adequate infrastructure for waste collection, transportation, and disposal. They should also promote the use of composting and recycling facilities</li>
			<li>Awareness Campaigns: Awareness campaigns can help educate people about the dangers of open burning of garbage and encourage them to adopt sustainable waste management practices. These campaigns can be conducted through various media such as television, radio, and social media </li>
			<li>Enforcement of Laws: Governments should enforce laws and regulations that prohibit open burning of garbage. They should also impose penalties on violators to deter them from engaging in this practice </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>5.Construction and Demolition</h3>
		<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee Construction and Demolition.jpeg">
		<p>During the clean air act movement, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) registered the highest number of air pollution complaints in the Delhi NCR due to construction pollution and demolition activities. With the rise of population in the city, construction and demolition is a part of the ever-going development phase of the national capital. Several construction sites and raw materials such as bricks and concrete cause haze and foul air which is hazardous for people especially, children and elderly citizens.

			Why is air quality a concern at construction and demolition sites? This is due to the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Construction and demolition sites are a rich source of PM and other air pollutants including VOCs, etc.</li>
				<li>People living near these sites experience various health concerns like difficulty in breathing, irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat, etc.</li>
				<li>The workers and personnel working on-site are exposed to these air pollutants everyday. These pollutants affect their health to a great extent as well.</li>
				<li>Therefore, it becomes important to monitor the air quality at construction and demolition sites to comply with the standards.</li>
				<li>It is important to maintain the air quality at these sites, so as to maintain the air quality standards and limit the excessive usage of toxin and PM generating activities.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>6.Agriculture activities</h3>
				<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee agriculture pollution.jpg">
				<p>Agricultural activities have had a serious impact on the decreasing air quality. To begin with, pesticides and fertilizers are the main sources that contaminate the surrounding air. Nowadays, pesticides and fertilizers are mixed with new invasive species which are not found in nature, for quick growth of the crops and vegetation. Once they are sprayed over, the smell and the effect of the pesticides are left in the air. Some mix with water and some seeps into the ground which not only destroys the crops but also causes numerous health-related issues.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), “About 40% of world emissions come from livestock, 16% from mineral fertilizers, 17% from burning biomass, and 8% come from agricultural wastes.” Agricultural activities include 4 activities that generate toxins that are released into the air. These are fertilizers and pesticides, animal husbandry, agricultural waste, and salts from applied irrigation water. Agricultural solids and waste are burnt in order to clear out the area for next cultivation, but this causes release of soot, PM, and other toxins into the air.
					</li></ul>
					<h3>7.Use of chemical and synthetic products</h3>
					<img style="width:480px;height:319px" src="chee chemical synthi.jpeg">
					<p>Talking about air pollution, we always consider outdoor air pollution dangerous for our lives but never talk about indoor air pollution. Household products cause indoor air pollution which is 10 times more harmful than outdoor air pollution. We spend more than 90% of our lives indoors, which makes the indoor air pollution impacts more serious and concerning. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) found in paints, cleaners and personal care products such as perfume and deodorants are a reason for common health issues. These are silent killers that can cause risks like asthma or other respiratory issues and lung disease are other issues caused by inhaling poor house air quality.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The vast variety of sources indoors release various harmful toxins that affect children, old age people, and even pets.</li>
						<li>These sources include cooking, smoking, furniture, paints, hobby craft, furnaces, coal powered heaters, and many more. Indoor air pollution has caused over 4 million premature deaths per year.</li>
						<li>Healthy air is very important for development in children, even in their prenatal phase. Air pollution has caused more than 50% of all cases of respiratory infection in children less than 5 years old.</li>
						<li>It is responsible for various lung and heart diseases in children and old people such as bronchitis, pneumonia, and aggravation of asthma.</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Method to control africulture activities pollution</h4>
					<p>Agricultural activities are one of the major sources of air pollution. The use of fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides in agriculture releases harmful chemicals into the atmosphere, which can cause respiratory problems and other health issues Here are some methods that can help control agricultural air pollution:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use of enhanced-efficiency fertilizers (EEFs): EEFs are designed to reduce the amount of fertilizer needed to grow crops, which in turn reduces the amount of nitrogen and other chemicals released into the air</li>
						<li>Soil amendments: Soil amendments such as compost, manure, and other organic materials can help improve soil health and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers 2</li>
						<li>crop rotation: Crop rotation can help reduce the amount of nitrogen and other chemicals in the soil, which can reduce the need for chemical fertilizers 2.</li>
						<li>Application of buffer zones: Buffer zones are areas of land that are planted with vegetation to help absorb pollutants before they can reach nearby waterways or other sensitive areas</li>
						<li>Avoiding unnecessary journeys and cultivation passes: Avoiding unnecessary journeys and cultivation passes can help reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions </li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Air Pollution In india and it's control method</h2>
					<p>Air pollution is a major concern in India, and the government has taken several steps to address it. Here are some of the measures taken by the Indian government to control air pollution</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Implementation of National Air Quality Index (AQI): The AQI is a standardized measure of air quality, which gives real-time information on air quality levels and health implications. The AQI is calculated by considering eight pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, and lead.</li>
						<li>Introduction of Bharat Stage (BS) emission standards: The BS emission standards are a set of emission standards for vehicles to control air pollution from vehicles. The standards are based on European emission standards and have been implemented in a phased manner since 2000.
						</li>
						<li>Promotion of clean fuel and technologies: The government of India has promoted the use of clean fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in vehicles, as well as cleaner technologies such as catalytic converters and particulate filters.
						</li>
						<li>Regulation of industrial emissions: The government of India has implemented various regulations to control industrial emissions, such as the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. These regulations specify emission standards for different industries, and provide for penalties and legal action against non-compliant industries.</li>
						<li>Control of construction and demolition activities: The government of India has implemented measures to control air pollution from construction and demolition activities, such as the use of dust suppression measures, regular water sprinkling, and green belts around construction sites.</li>
						<li>Ban on open burning of waste: The government of India has banned the open burning of waste, which is a major source of air pollution. Violators are liable to pay a fine and face legal action.</li>
						<li>Promotion of public transport: The government of India has promoted the use of public transport, such as buses and metros, to reduce air pollution from vehicles. This includes initiatives such as the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and the Metro Rail Transit System (MRTS).</li>
						<li>Introduction of green tax: The government of India has introduced a green tax, which is levied on vehicles based on their emission levels. This tax is intended to encourage the use of cleaner vehicles and reduce air pollution from vehicles.</li>
						<li>Air pollution monitoring and control: The government of India has set up a network of air quality monitoring stations across the country, which measure air quality levels and provide real-time information to the public. The government also has a National Air Quality Control Programme, which coordinates air pollution control efforts across different states and sectors.</li>
						<li>Public awareness and education: The government of India has launched various public awareness campaigns to educate the public about the causes and impacts of air pollution, and ways to reduce it. These campaigns include television and radio advertisements, posters, and social media campaigns.</li>
